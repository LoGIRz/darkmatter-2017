# darkmatter-2017

This repository is a placeholder for the citizen-science-style research project focused on dark-matter-like signal search in OPERA datasets.

Milestones:

1. read MC/real data, combine it into a single brick
2. recognize em-shower tracks with known origin
3. recognize em-shower tracks with no origin information
4. recognize several em-showers with no origin information
5. recognize many overlapping em-showers with no origin information
